 Welcome to Observe. One of the key ways to investigate data in your environment is through the log explorer available on the left-hand menu. Here you can select a logs-related data set, and here I'll take a look at container logs from my demo data that's hosted on Kubernetes. Here I can view these logs, and then on the left-hand menu here I can filter to specific fields or columns. And the query will automatically update to show that data. I can also use the expression builder up here to filter for things like an error. And then I can investigate my error messages, or I could also look at the related resources that indicate where this log came from, like the pod, container, cluster, namespace, and more. If I click into any of these related resources, I can quickly get an overview or view related metrics in real time. Now if I'm in an incident, and I want to see these logs in near real time, I can use the live mode up here. And lastly, I can use the actions menu up here to quickly pivot into creating a monitor, and then alert on these error messages.
