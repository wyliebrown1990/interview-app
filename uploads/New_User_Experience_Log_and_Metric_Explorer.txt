 Over the past six months, we've become obsessed with ease of use in the new user experience and observe. We've conducted dozens of user interviews and live usability tests that have made major improvements to observe UI based on this feedback. Like to share a few of these improvements with you now. First, I'm excited to announce our new log explorer UI. The log explorer is intended to be a one-stop destination to browse, search, and analyze all of your log data. When you come to the log explorer, you can quickly flip between all of the log sources being sent to observe. You can easily search for errors and other keywords, and you can visualize the results of your search all without leaving this one page. Because all data and observe is linked together, you can also drill in on these log messages to see additional context, like the configuration of related resources or even related metrics. After finding the log data you're looking for, you can share a link with a colleague, create a monitor to watch for errors, or add your visualization to a dashboard. The log explorer UI is driven by a new query builder, which was designed specifically for working with log data. This means that you can access all of this functionality without learning or using a new query language. Along with the log explorer, we've also introduced a new metric explorer UI. The metric explorer is intended to be a first-class destination to find, plot, and analyze all of your metrics data. You can quickly search and browse all of your metrics with a metric picker. After picking a metric, you can use the metric expression builder to configure filters and aggregations for plotting your metrics. You can then drill in on these charts and quickly pivot to any related logs and dashboards. Once you're satisfied with your chart, you can share with others, you can create a monitor, or you can add it to a dashboard. Like the log explorer, all of these actions can be accomplished without using a query language, so new users can settle in quickly. Now for both of these explorers, we had two goals in mind. We wanted to streamline the adoption of Observe for users migrating from existing open source or commercial monitoring tools. These new experiences should feel familiar and intuitive to new users no matter where you're coming from. Second, we wanted to make it even easier to take advantage of Observe's unique ability to link and correlate all of your data together through connected resources. That is, anytime you see a user, a service, or a container, and observe, it should be as simple as clicking on it to navigate to related logs, metrics, traces, and dashboards. Now in addition to the new explorers, we've also revamped the navigation bar in the product to make dashboards, monitors, and ingest configuration easier to access. We've introduced a customizable homepage to help you organize content for your team. We've updated dashboard editor with a new focus editing mode and much, much more. I'm excited for you to try the new Hubble UI.
