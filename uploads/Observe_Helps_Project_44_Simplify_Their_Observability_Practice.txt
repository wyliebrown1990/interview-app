 I'm Tony Noons. I'm the North American and South American support director for Project 44. Project 44 is a logistics kin offering a great software to compile all your data and make end-to-end visibility for your shipments. And observability is a huge part of that for us. So to take something like observability and being able to dive into data dive into every piece of data that we have is really what our business is about. We wanted to make things simpler, clearer, easier, friendlier. Tracking shipments, I know it seems really simple from the front end. You look on the website and you find out where your bathroom is or your Wonder Woman cake pan. But you're ultimately stuck with all this data that's happening behind the scenes. Project 44 is an organization. Compiles that data normalizes it for customers. But for us looking at it and support, it's not normalizing customers. We have to kind of do that on our own. One of the biggest benefits that we see is turnaround time. And resolve time is everything in support. Being able to find access to the pin-pointed data that you need to understand is this problem with us. Is it with a carrier? Is it with the API? Is there a communication problem? To be able to locate that quickly is the difference between a happy customer and a sad customer. One of the new rollouts of the dashboards that that observe put together really helps staff starting from square one. We're able to build dashboards that say, here are the pieces you're going to need to know about this shipment. Here's your API log, here's your server request, here's your client request, here's all the data that you need to assess the shipment for the customer. The possibilities for observer are really endless and it's what your imagination can picture with that data.
