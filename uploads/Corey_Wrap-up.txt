 And there you have it. To my perspective, what sets observe apart is the fact that they're talking about the pain that they solve for their customers without denigrating where their customers are on their incredible journey. They're doing it without having to spend years explaining it to people. And most importantly, they're meeting customers where they are with the problems and pains they're feeling today rather than talking about the far future. I think they're launching today at ObserveInk.com. I'd encourage you to go and sign up for early access, the first 100 people who do get something a little special. But then I want you to tell me whether it's good or whether it's crap. I have problems in case it wasn't blindly obvious, but they don't look like most other people's problems. So I'm curious to folks who are running these things in the wild. What do you think about this? I've already been paid. I just want to know what stories you're hearing from this. Is it as good as I think it is? Let me know. I'm Cloud Economist Corey Quinn and this has been The Launch of Observe.
