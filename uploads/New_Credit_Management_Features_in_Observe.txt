 One of the common concerns with usage-based pricing is how to keep spend within a desired budget. At Observe, we are obsessed with giving our customers full control of their tooling costs. I'm excited to tell you about three new features that are going to help with the same. First up, usage governor is a new feature that can help customers stay within a configurable budget. It works by tracking your average credit usage in a rolling time window. It will warn users when usage hits 80% of the configured budget or reject queries when usage exceeds the limit. The admin has the capability to define budgetary limits for both transforms and query to stay within their budget. Moving on to the next feature, Acceleration consent, which is designed for when a user queries outside of the accelerator range of a data set. Observe will now ask users for their consent before kicking off an on-demand backfill. This will make sure user is aware and they're able to use their budget where they need it the most. Next up is our usage dashboard to which we've made a few improvements. Users can now drill down to understand their credit usage by data set by monitor but package and by user. The dashboard will also have an overview of usage governor's behavior. This will include things like credits consumed against the configured limit analyst of bypass queries. We are confident that these features will empower our customer to be in the dry receipt and take advantage of a true usage based pricing model.
