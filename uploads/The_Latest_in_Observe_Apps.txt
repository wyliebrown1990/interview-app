 We've been doubling down on providing out-of-box use cases for customers with the observables apps. First off, we made a bunch of improvement to our existing apps. We expanded AWS app to support Amazon CloudWatch synths settings. This allows you to monitor your endpoints and API, so you can continually verify your customer experience even if you don't have any customer traffic on your applications. We also made it easier to set up host monitoring app with the auto installation script. This eliminates the needs to manually install and configure three separate agents. I'd like to also highlight a few of our new apps. We introduce a GCP app. It comes with auto box dataset dashboard and monitor for five popular GCP services, compute engine, cloud load balancing, cloud storage, cloud SQL and cloud functions. Support for BigQuery and GKE are coming soon. If you're already using Prometheus NodeExporter for host monitoring, you can now integrate with the Observe in minutes. All you have to do is install the NodeExporter apps and configure Prometheus to include Observe as a destination. You will get dashboard for CPU, memory and network disk out-of-box. We're committed to making it easy to observe your entire stack. That's why we're continuing to invest in CI-CD and code-level integrations with Jenkins app and GitHub app. This will help our customer quickly identify which PR calls a service audit or long response time, reducing the meantime to recover dramatically. But wait, there's more. Introducing the Open Telemetry app, a complete solution for tracing. It provides a prescriptive ingest guidance, visualizations and dataset for tracing use case. Beyond these apps, we are working on Azure, GitLab and many more in the future. Stay tuned.
