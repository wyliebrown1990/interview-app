 Every day AI is a perfect opportunity for all of the AI practitioners to meet together, to understand what's next, what has been done, what could be difficult to achieve, and it's a good opportunity for us to meet. I think we are in a new era where everything seems possible and we have many opportunities both to change our daily lives and to maybe tackle the main challenges that we face as humanity. For me, every day AI is a really great opportunity to meet experts from across industries and different companies because it's usually we are copying the same kind of problems and solution so it's good to understand really what different companies are doing with AI especially Gen AI and how data I use really helping them to democratize AI in a company. Every day AI means that I can use AI on an everyday basis to improve my work, increase my quality of my work of the code but also by answering questions for our company colleagues. Every AI for me is helping the business, sometimes without even them knowing it, with AI. Every day AI means very simple that AI arrived in the middle of all lives. It needs to be an everyday theme. It's not something that you use only from time to time, but AI is really crucial nowadays for enterprises to be successful, to stay competitive. For me every day AI means always seeking innovation in new ways of doing things in a more efficient manner that's not only streamline our processes but actually add the values of our customers.
