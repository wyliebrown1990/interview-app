 Metrics are generated by machines, and with most tools, you feel like you need to be a machine to understand them. A few years ago, I watched an engineer try and build a Prometheus alert. It took them days to get it right, and the end result made little sense to other engineers on call. That's why I'm happy to announce our new metric-alerting experience. It's built by and for humans. We've introduced a Metrics expression builder. The builder makes it easy for anyone to alert on Metrics, even if they have to do more complex arithmetic. And for the power users out there, you can always dive into the opal and customize your query. Our expression builder takes advantage of Graphlink. That means you aren't restricted to filtering or grouping by tags. You can bring in any related field in our system, like a customer or a user, and do so regardless of cardinality. At every step of the way, you can look at the preview, which will help you understand how the alert would have behaved in the past. We've also revamped the alert page, so it's easy to never define the critical information you need when responding to an incident.
