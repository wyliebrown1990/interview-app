 There's an explosion of innovation that's happening around us. You see the evolution. I think we're just going to continue to see acceleration and breakthroughs. To me, AI, it's all about people. I see AI as a tool to get where we can go, where we couldn't go before. The reality is every job. Your job, my job, it's going to be impacted by AI at some point. These are complex molecular tools and there's algorithms and AI. Available to us so that we can draw insights from the data. Which then gives you better treatment, better diagnostics, better therapies. Add a much greater pace and with much greater efficiency. We think that is an incredible opportunity. That will change the face of health care as we know. The sky's the limit.
