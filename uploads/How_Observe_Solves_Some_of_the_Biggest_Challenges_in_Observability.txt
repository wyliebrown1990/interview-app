 The SaaS applications these days, they've gotten really complex with all the multi-tenancy on the network and infrastructure that the data traverses through and so many different applications and monitoring tools, but you know, you can scale all of that with just people. The technology standpoint, we deal with massive amount of data and we also have the challenge to deliver personalized experience in real time. We recently transitioned our software development efforts to use modern tools such as containers, clustering, and orchestration, which provided us with considerable operational efficiency, but that costs visibility. The root cause analysis is just spread around different log files and consoles and monitoring systems and stock traces and new name. So for us to be able to identify what's going on is the challenge that our learning systems are noisy. Most of my team could legitimately ignore 50 to 60% of their emails and that number is higher for me. Right now we have to go through multiple systems, log into multiple things. We have a dashboard separate, we have a log monitoring that is separate, and then we have an API monitoring that is separate. So you have to be able to connect the dots across all of these systems. Application logs are spread across multiple compute nodes. We rarely know what node is servicing a client when there's an error. It's really an aggregation problem. We need a system to gather data from all of our application containers and store it in one place, preferably in the cloud so we don't have to maintain anything on site. With the tool like observe, all of them come into one place. We get into a dashboard. My infrastructure is mapped and I can go from a trouble ticket to solving the issue in one place. Observe takes the idea of event relationships to the next level. It allows us to drill down from a big picture view into more granular data, but it also provides us visibility into related event streams. In addition to providing the standard searching and filtering tools that we've relied on for years. It really helps us with root cause analysis. We have a lot of different systems to track log files, our uptime, we have monitoring and learning system, and for us to reach the root cause analysis is just trying to match up those different sources and observe helps us really identify call it the data and put it in one place. Their whole philosophy is that the clients shouldn't have to write queries or regular expressions. That makes me really happy. The functionality is available, but observe would prefer that the clients didn't ever use it. Generally, we don't have a lot of time to write queries and to parse and organize log data that we only use when an application is broken. When an application is broken, we definitely don't have time to try to figure out queries or regular expressions. How well the user experience has been thought up? As a very junior support person, customer success or a product person, I can jump into the UI, look at the dashboard, see where the problem is, and I can almost get to the root cause of the problem, and being able to provide all of this good troubleshooting information to the engineer, and the engineer can solve the problem quickly. We believe that the focus that the product has on event correlation and relationships will go a long way to helping us generate useful relevant alerts. That helps us deliver better customer experience in the end.
