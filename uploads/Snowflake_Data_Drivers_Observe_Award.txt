 Hello, I'm Denise Pearson, Chief Marketing Officer at Snowflake. The Snowflake Data Drivers Awards is a global awards program recognizing innovative individuals and teams that are transforming the organizations and the world around them using data. Every year we review hundreds of nominations from Snowflake customers around the world. Finally, the winners are show-sanned by a panel of industry experts and Snowflake leaders. Over the last year we've been transforming Snowflake from being the world's leading cloud data warehouse into the world's leading cloud data platform. Our goal is to grow a large ecosystem of companies who are building businesses on top of Snowflake. To mark this shift, we've introduced a new category to the Data Drivers Award called Best Data Application. And I'm delighted to announce that Observe has been selected the winner in 2020. Observes SaaS Observability Platform runs exclusively on Snowflake and takes advantage of many cutting-edge features. We're looking forward to working with Observe to enable our joint customers to investigate their applications and infrastructure and order of magnitude faster and cheaper than ever before. As a permanent reminder of this win, we'll be sending over this Data Drivers Award's trophy over to the Observe team. Congratulations.
