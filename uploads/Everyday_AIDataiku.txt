 The whole point of this is just being able to democratize data a little more and more each day. Data IQ is a very powerful tool. It makes data and AI a part of the everyday decision-making process. Being able to scale out data analytics and machine learning across thousands of people because it can't be centralized anymore. It's got to be democratized. You can literally drag and drop very powerful recipes or essentially processes. Excellent UI UX. You don't have to have a PhD in computer science to access things. Not a data scientist by training for sure, but I can do data science now. Tools like data IQ are huge accelerants. We start using the data IQ class from for a reason. Speeding up our onboarding of new data scientists from the two to half months, could just two weeks. IQ helped us move our access to data from the millions to the billions to the trillion. You need to make sure you've got the right controls that privacy concerns are managed. You don't just democratize it here, right? We have to do in a very methodical way, particularly in a regulated environment. Everything is locked. Every step is audited. Being a Swiss bank, we're quite serious about protection and our client information. So there's a whole security framework around it to make sure they get access to data on new to no principle. Data IQ has been a huge part of the analytic democratization process that we use. Thank you for the data IQ. It's really supercharged.
