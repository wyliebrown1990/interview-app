 Data Prep typically takes a lot of time and effort. With DataIQ, simply explain the steps and transformations you want in plain English and let the AI assistant do the heavy lifting. For example, here we have some raw data we need to clean up with a prepare recipe. Since I'm not sure which processor is the best one to resolve all the zip codes in this zip column to a standard 5-digit code, I'll just ask the AI prepare feature to extract the first 5 characters for me. And while I'm at it, might as well do the same action for the work zip code column too. And then remove the original columns as we'll no longer need them, all in the same request. The AI assistant quickly suggests a series of steps, which I can accept or modify the prompt further if needed. Interesting, looks like it's using this upstream function. Not only did the assistant save me the time of testing out different ways to solve this problem, but as a bonus, I also learned something new for next time. Next, I want to take this raw date column and calculate the age of the account. Again, I'll simply explain what I want and let AI prepare go to work. To make adjustments or further customizations to any step, I can either fine tune the AI prompt or edit the steps directly. For instance, in these parsed dates, it seems like some of the rows have missing values because there are multiple date formats in the original column. By adding the additional date formats, I can resolve this issue and ensure I have the account age for all rows. Done. Not only is the data prep done in a fraction of the time, but the team also has auto documentation and a visual record of both the AI prompt and the generated solution, with the ability to tweak and customize the steps as much as desired. In other words, you get all the benefits of AI magic, plus the transparency and control you've come to expect from DataIQU, so you can trust the results. It's a win-win.
