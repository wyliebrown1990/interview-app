 Like any leader and being a leader in this organization, when you have a bunch of engineers that have to use a tool, the easier it is to use that tool saves the company really a ton of money. And we move so fast here. Like it's a rocket ship over here. We're moving so fast. It's crazy. And we didn't have time to have to devote really learning observe. It was really easy to learn right out of the box. Another thing you guys have incorporated into your observability tool is AI. I can ask a question. And instead of it giving me a link to a document, it takes the steps from the document and just prints them out. I thought that was brilliant. We want to do that. Troubleshooting is great. It's fast and easy. And it doesn't matter what part of the organization is doing the troubleshooting. Everybody has learned how to do it in a very similar way. It's really nice. One thing that did happen, we did have an accidental data spike. Like our data went from two or three terabytes to data, 10 terabytes a day. And the system didn't even hiccup. It just kept running. It always had. The speed was there. Everything was there. But one of the things that is the most special part about this product I have to say is your customer support is beyond stellar. It's amazing. But my big fear was going to be the cost. Because we had shifted to Kubernetes. I know the logs and Kubernetes are just huge. When you go from bare metal to Kubernetes, your logs triple and quadruple. And when we looked at the price, I really couldn't believe it. It was a fair price. It would easily ramp up our ability to do observability. And it gave us some really great tools. All of these things have really married me to this product. I can't see using another observability tool. It gives us everything we need. The support is just stellar. It is first class.
