 We keep refining our query language, OPPO, that powers all the data processing and observe. And here are a few highlights. I sometimes want to merge loglines to combine JavaScript traces into a single event, or debounds noisy sensory data. We added a powerful verb called merge events, which lets me do just that. And with Schemaun Reed, I can always go back and change it later and see it update my view of the past. Once I find the event I'm looking for, I can use the surrounding feature to find things that happen right around the time of that event in that context. When working with intermediate results in the console, I cannot directly type in sub queries without having to make cards in the UI. This helped us build our in-product usage reporting, which is a product feature built entirely as an application on the Observe platform itself. These are some examples of the 20 new verbs and features we built to improve productivity and capability. And you can read more about all of them at our newly upgraded documentation site at docs.observing.com.
