 I think there's a lot of hype still about big data which I thought we'd got rid of maybe five, ten years ago as a topic but I go to conferences and I speak to customers and they're still really obsessed by how much data they're processing but they can't quite articulate what value that is generated. I hate to say it but you know when you look at you know the hype cycle and all the fun things that are coming in all these regranforcement learning, transfer learning, and all these different things that people talk about from fancy algorithm techniques and data science techniques. I was like most of them really aren't relevant from a business standpoint. Some of them are and some of them will be in like the 1% of the 1% use cases but when you look at the problems that people are trying to solve they're simple solutions in the end. They're hard to achieve but they don't need all of the fancy topics, all the fancy algorithms. They're overblown for the vast majority of use cases that will make people successful. Well MLOps is hot. I think the way that people think about MLOps is not necessarily super hot. MLOps kind of ties in with what I was just saying around actually having to do something worthwhile with the data science or the AI that you're building so it's about deploying the models you create. A lot of folks especially engineers really think about MLOps from this tooling perspective where they think oh well you know if I just pick like the five right CICD application blah blah blahs my life is going to be complete and everything is going to work but that perspective in MLOps I think is really short-sighted and it should really actually be about how do I gauge whether my model is making my company money, how do I gauge whether my model is still performing well, how do I ensure that deploying that model is going to be successful, it's really about outcomes, not about tools.
