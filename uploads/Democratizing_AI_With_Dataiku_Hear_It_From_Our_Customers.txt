 Data IQ is a very powerful tool. It makes data and AI part of everyday decision-making process. The whole point of this is just being able to democratize data a little more and more each day. So again, we want to put that ownership back into the hands of the business instead of sitting within a central data organization in IT. Being able to scale our data analytics and machine learning across thousands of people, because it can't be centralized anymore. It's got to be democratized. Working in tools like data IQ to build plugins and different tools that analysts the business could use and making it more accessible, lowering the barriers to entry. You can literally drag and draft very powerful recipes or essentially processes. Excellent UI UX. You don't have to have a PhD in computer science to access things. Now I'm not a data scientist by training for sure, but I can do data science now.
