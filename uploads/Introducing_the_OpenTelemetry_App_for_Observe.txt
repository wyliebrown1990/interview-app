 Since our launch, we've had customers using Observe to store, analyze, and alert on their open telemetry data. The feedback we received from these early adopters is a like a more prescriptive out-of-the-box solution for troubleshooting their microservice applications instrument with Open Telemetry. Today, I'm happy to announce the new Observe app for Open Telemetry, which does just that. We're firm believers in Open Telemetry's vision of commodity, vendor-neutral data collection, and as a result, getting Open Telemetry data into Observe is a breeze. Observe has an endpoint for ingesting OTOP data, so all you have to do is configure Open Telemetry collector to export data at it. And if you're using our Kubernetes integration, we handle all of the setup for you. Once this data is in, you can use our out-of-the-box dashboards to understand the performance of all of the services your application depends on, and even drill into individual traces. With our new waterfall visualization, it's easy to diagnose problematic traces by seeing which spans per slow or had an error. The best part is that we treat tracing data like any other data to observe, which means that you can use our schema and demand and grappling capabilities to refine and link your Open Telemetry data to any other log, metric, or resource data in Observe. So what this mainstream out-of-the-box experience is that your Open Telemetry data is linked to the Kubernetes, AWS, and host monitoring apps in Observe, so you can easily correlate application issues with infrastructure issues. Now, we ourselves use Open Telemetry to analyze the performance of Observe, and we're proud to now share this capability with you.
