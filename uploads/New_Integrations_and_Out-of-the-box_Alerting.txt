 All right, so we've been working closely with the big batch of new customers or the past few months, get them up and running and observe. One of the common requests we've been getting from these new customers is to provide really more prescriptive guidance on how to configure observe to monitor and troubleshoot their applications. So towards that goal, we've been working on our out-of-the-box solutions to support more common scenarios you might encounter and I wanted to highlight a couple of these improvements. So first, we've greatly expanded on the observed AWS integration that we introduced last year. So now in addition to the 109 data sets that we provide to organize all of this data streaming out of AWS, we now provide dozens of pre-configured alerts to help you proactively monitor your services. And we've also expanded on the breadth of this integration with new support for Fargate-backed ECS and EKS clusters and much, much more. Second, we've released a new solution for monitoring plain Linux servers. Our Linux host monitoring solution brings together everything we've learned about collecting data from plain servers and includes support for scraping logs, monitoring host metrics like disk space and memory usage, gathering configuration information like what packages are installed, and even collecting performance metrics about individual processes running on those servers. We provide out-of-the-box data sets, dashboards, and alerts for all this data, and we even link it with Graphlink to all the content available in our other integrations. Now beyond these two, we're trialling new integrations for Google Cloud Platform, for Jenkins, and there's much, much more to come throughout the year.
