 Imagine it's 3am and you get paged. You open a dashboard and see a giant spike. It should be easy to get to the root cause from here, but it's not. The spike is actually a dead end. When we built our dashboarding feature, we did not want to build another single glass of paint. Observe understands relationships in your data, so our dashboards do too. When you see a spike, you can click on it and actually figure out what it means. Whether that's a node, user, log, metric, or whatever else you have linked in the system.
