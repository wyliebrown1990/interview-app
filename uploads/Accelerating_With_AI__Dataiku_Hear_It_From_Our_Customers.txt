 Tools like DataIQ are a huge of tolerance. It's actually more efficient to just teach them a low-code, no-code type tool like DataIQ. At Convex we've bought DataIQ and I think it's an amazingly powerful tool to use more data than we've ever been able to use before. When we're using tools like DataIQ to stitch together data and automate some of our processes, the byproduct of that is about a 60% reduction in overall cycle time. We started using the DataIQ platform for a reason. Speeding up our onboarding of new data scientists from the two to half months, to just two weeks. IQ helped us move our access to data from the millions to the billions to the trillion.
