 Hi, my name is Ethan Lilly. I'm a senior engineering manager here at Topgolf And I've been here for about four and a half years and I love it here It's a great place to work observability is very important to us at Topgolf Technology is is what drives the whole venue if if any one piece goes down It could affect the entire player experience from the games to getting into your bay to just making a reservation online So we have to make sure everything is up and running at all times So before we used to have to use multiple tools I used to have three monitors up in my desk with different tools open all at the same time trying to correlate This time stamp over here with this time stamp over here But with observe it's all in one place and you can see it all in one view And you don't have to jump around different monitors You can just easily click through the UI and find exactly what you're looking for Observe you knew right away that this this tool was different this tool is very helpful and giving us the data We need and correlating that data for us so observe as much easier to use another tooling And it definitely gets us up and running faster and keeps us that way One of our favorite games at Topgolf is Angry Birds Players will hit their ball and we'll use camera systems to track the ball flight And then overlay that onto the game so that it tracks your bird flies exactly the same path as your ball We had an issue at one of our venues where some of the balls were not getting traced properly So using observe we were able to correlate the game log data with our hardware metrics and figure out that there was a Misconfiguration on the back end infrastructure After fixing it players were able to once again hit the balls and let the birds fly At Topgolf we continue to add new venues every year each new venue comes with a whole new set of data With observe we're able to keep our data for up to a year which allows us to monitor that data over an extended period of time And show us different trends that may be appearing that we may not have noticed before Before we used to have to pay per user for people to access our monitoring data With observe we can have as many users as we want Allowing us to give access to everyone that we would like to see our data and clean our support teams our development teams And anybody else that we think might be useful. We needed a solution that would scale with us and observe is that solution
