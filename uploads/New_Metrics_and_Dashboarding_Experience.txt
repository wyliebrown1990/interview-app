 Since releasing our dashboarding and metric expression builder features in May, we've been hard at work getting feedback from our users and making improvements. Let's review a few of the major ones. First off, the metric expression builder is now available in worksheets and dashboards. That means users can visualize complex, multi metric expressions without using query language. We've also added support for parameters in metric expressions, so users can easily make their dashboards configurable. Power users will be happy to know that the opal for their query is always a click away in the script tab. On the dashboarding front, we've taken a look at the things that users struggle with when creating dashboards. Textboxes and drop downs are great to put on dashboard when you know exactly the sort of filter a user might want. But sometimes, you just can't know that ahead of time. To solve this, we've introduced a new type of parameter that we call a filtered data set. The filtered data set parameter makes every field in a data set available for filtering. It supports many different kinds of filtering, like inclusion and exclusion, wild cards, numeric ranges, and more. This leverages all of the powerful context that observe extracts from your data. Lastly, we made a big improvement to our filter bar by adding first class JSON support. Previously, users had to extract JSON fields before filtering on them. With this latest improvement, users can access and filter any JSON field on the fly. This also extends to filtering and grouping in the metric expression builder. We're really looking forward to seeing the stories our users can now tell with these exciting new features. Thank you.
