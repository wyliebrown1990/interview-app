 Welcome back to DIM or deeply innovative metrics, the 1961 edition. In part one, we covered walk-a-byte scale databases and algebraically correct query languages. In this show, we'll cover many more must-haves for every Rockstar X-Full-Stack engineer. Next up today, let's cover dashboards. That is a UI or user interface. Remember, you can never have enough dashboards. If you see one you like, you just copy it and make it your own. Contrary to popular belief, dashboards are state-of-the-art, incredibly useful, and never, ever break. Boops. Boops. Next up, tagging, lots and lots of tagging. Packed asian, you're it. Ah! Jason, do you know what a DIM tag is? And last but not least, we need to cover alerts. And there's one now. Let's walk over to our alert operator, Ms. Phyllis Stein, to find out what's going on. Phyllis, what is that particular alert for? Is an application down? Phyllis? Is the CPU being plotted by server instead of by process? Is that pizza here yet? Oh. Looks like Phyllis has a bad case of alert fatigue. Sorry about that. We'll address that in our next show. And speaking of our next show, tuning next week when we'll take an in-depth look at logs. We'll show you how to determine the true age of any log by examining timestamps in our cross section. But that's for next time, so don't miss it.
