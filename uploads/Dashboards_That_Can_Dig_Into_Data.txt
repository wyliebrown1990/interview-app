 When we created our dashboarding feature, we wanted to go beyond the high-level isolated summaries of what's going on in your infrastructure software or business. We wanted to make dashboards a starting point for investigations and insights, not the frustrating dead ends they typically are. Because we understand the relationships in your data, the things in your business and software, when you create a dashboard, the panels naturally connect to each other and relevant content like metrics can be brought in quickly, no need to search. When you work with a dashboard, we continue to leverage this understanding of the things in the dashboard and use their relationships to connect you to other views of that data, whether it's more detailed dashboards or worksheets ready to continue your investigation.
