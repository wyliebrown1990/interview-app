 My name is Andre Butsar. I am the director of Cloud and DevOps at Mind Data. I went to college for computer engineering. I actually started my career in helpdesk, moved on to system engineering. I play a lot with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and automating things around the house. My data is a FinTech company. We provide front-middle and back-office products for hedge funds, wealth managers, and banks. One of my responsibilities is to manage the Cloud Platform team, which is responsible for building as-code frameworks to be reused by the various business units and engineering teams, as well as develop DevSecOps and GitHub's processes to improve developer velocity and quality of life. A lot of organizations, they might have monitoring, but monitoring is only a piece of observability. Observability is what brings all of the different pieces together, tracing metrics, monitoring, logging. Security is always tough of mind for me. We have dozens and dozens of AWS accounts, but with Observe, we can create linkages not only across resources but across accounts, which makes it very easy for our engineers to isolate issues, especially when you have dependencies on different services from different accounts. So we can troubleshoot an issue in our multi-account AWS architecture in Observe without ever having to log into an actual AWS account. It's not just security of the application, but it's also the security of the infrastructure is the compliance, the auditing. When we developed our GitHub process, we had SOC 2 and Monty. We're able to link Cloud Trail to the pull request information in Observe so that every single Cloud Trail event has links back to a pull request. So in the Observe UI, I can look at a Cloud Trail event and I will see who created the pull request, what the comment is exactly what's happening, who opened it, who merged it, who closed it, what had happened. Observe stood out to me for the simple fact that you can link disparate data sets together. You no longer have to copy and paste and remember what it is that you're looking for because one data set can need you to the next and the next like a trail of breadcrumbs until you find your way to the issue. The impact on line data has been tremendous, providing our engineering team all of the same resources that our SREs have in order to manage their engineering environments. That has allowed us to develop more secure applications and release better quality code into production.
