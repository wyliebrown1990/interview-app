 Welcome to Observe. A great way to investigate metrics in your environment is through the metric explorer here available on the left hand menu. The first thing you want to do is search for your specific metric. Here I can search for my demo data memory to see related container memory usage metrics. Once selected, I can see this metric here visualized in the explorer and then I can use the expression builder to then search to specific fields like the container to specify my specific recommendation service. Up here I can select auto run or run the query myself. I can extend the time frame here with the time picker. But I can also drill into my visualization by clicking and dragging to then narrow in my search. I can also adjust the visualization settings and then if I'm happy and want to share this with the rest of my team, I can use the share button to copy and share a link which incorporates the exact state of this query. Lastly, I can use the actions menu to either create a monitor or add this to an existing dashboard or create a new one and start from scratch.
